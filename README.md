### Reflection

An issue I had with this assignment was adding the formspree into the form, I'm not sure if it's actually working the way it should be but I think it is because of the way I implemented it into my code.

- Just noticed I copy and pasted something wrong with the formspree but it didn't seem to change much

Another issue I had was figuring out how to get the form to just sit on the right side of the page, gave me a lot of trouble surprisingly.

- Made the background of the form transparent though which I thought was cool
